							<p>Version 1.3.0 Beta 2 - February 26, 2024</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="words">
						<p class="notice">Note: This is still an early version of CustomTube 1.3.0, and still contains many of the issues the previous beta had. This Beta was released earlier than intended in order to provide a solution to YouTube's new watch grid layout.</p>
						<p>- Improvement: "New", "LIVE", "Fundraiser", and other badges now appear on related videos [This affects all layouts]</p>
						<p>- Improvement: Channel names are now clickable on related videos [This affects all layouts] (This was also in Beta 1, but I forgot to put it in the changelog)</p>
						<p>- Improvement: Some minor code improvements</p>
						<p>- Fix: Fixed most issues caused by YouTube's new "Watch grid" layout [Affects all layouts, the layout was completely broken for those who had the new layout]</p>
						<p>- Fix: Icons now display on the owner actions bar on videos</p>
						<p>- Fix: Chapter links in the video description now display properly</p>
						<p>- Fix: If a video has no description, it will now say "<i>No description available.</i>" [This was supposed to happen in the previous version, but didn't work due to a bug]</p>
						<p>- Fix: Add to watch later and Open link in new tab now work on the autoplay video</p>
						<p>- Fix: Potentially fixed the orginal watch metadata HTML sometimes showing up instead of the replaced HTML</p>
						<p>- Changed: 3 stars is now considered a like on the 2008 and Late 2009 layouts.</p>

							<p>Version 1.3.0 Beta 1 - February 20, 2024</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="words">
						<p class="notice">Note: This is a <strong>very</strong> early version of CustomTube 1.3.0. This release has several issues, both in accuracy and functionality. 
						Some options are not functional yet, including some options that worked in previous versions of CustomTube.</p>
						<strong>- Improvement: The watch metadata HTML has now been replaced, which means that the watch page is now much more accurate, and is much less likely to break with YouTube updates [this affects all layouts, excluding the unmodified current layout]</strong>
						<p></p>
						<p>- Improvement: The related videos HTML has now been replaced</p>
						<p>- New: Added the option to choose your watch layout (ex. you can use Watch7 on the 2019 layout, or Watch4 on the 2014 layout).</p>
						<p>- New: Added 2 new player size options: 1600x900, and 1920x1080.</p>
						<p>- New: CustomTube now brings back dislike counts (This is made possible with the Return YouTube Dislike API)</p>
						<p>- New: Added the option to choose the related videos header</p>
						<p>- Improvement: Custom player sizes now work on the 2013 layouts.</p>
						<p>- Improvement: Full view counts are now displayed on related videos</p>
						<p>- Fix: Thanks to the watch metadata HTML being replaced, several watch page bugs have been fixed, notably the "share button duplication" bug of the 2013-2014 layouts</p>
						<p>- Other: Made changes to the Configuration window for the Beta release.</p>
						<p>- Other: Removed the "Disable Rich Grid Watch Page" option, as there is no longer a reason for its existence.</p>
						<p>- Other: Removed the "Enable Return YouTube Dislike Compatibility" option, since the Return YouTube Dislike extension no longer works with CustomTube (due to the replaced watch page HTML)</p>

						<p>- Improvement: The comment box now has better styling [Affects all layouts from 2008-2017]</p>

						Some links were also moved around.</p>
						<p>- Changed: Some text on the configuration window was changed. Most notably: The "Sidebar" tab has been renamed to "Guide", and the "Polymer layout" section was renamed to "Kevlar layout".
						These changes were made for accuracy purposes.</p>
						<p>- Fix: The like button would appear glitched when signed out [This affected various layouts]</p>
